# LendingClub Credit Risk Analysis (Data Engineering Project)

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing LendingClub loan data to assess credit risk and build a data engineering pipeline using modern tools like PySpark, Apache Airflow, and PostgreSQL. 

## Objective
The goal is to extract insights about borrower behavior, payment history, and investor activity — and to prepare the data for downstream analytics and reporting.

**Dataset**: [Loan - Credit Risk & Population Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beatafaron/loan-credit-risk-and-population-stability) from Kaggle.<br>
