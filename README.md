# LendingClub Credit Risk Analysis (Data Engineering Project)

## üß† Overview
This project focuses on analyzing LendingClub loan data to assess credit risk and build a data engineering pipeline using modern tools like PySpark, Apache Airflow, and PostgreSQL. 

## Objective
The goal is to extract insights about borrower behavior, payment history, and investor activity ‚Äî and to prepare the data for downstream analytics and reporting.

**Dataset**: [Loan - Credit Risk & Population Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beatafaron/loan-credit-risk-and-population-stability) from Kaggle.<br>

## Project Architecture
- **Batch Pipeline**: Built a Snowflake DWH integrating PostgreSQL and S3 sources, transformed into a Star Schema, and connected to Power BI for analytics.<br>
      - CSV ‚Üí Multi-source Simulation (Postgres/S3) using Pyspark ‚Üí Airbyte ‚Üí DWH / Star Schema ‚Üí dbt ‚Üí Dashboard.
- **Streaming Pipeline**: 
- **Deployment** : Entire stack containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

  
## üß± Batch Pipeline Breakdown
1. **Data Source**: [Loan - Credit Risk & Population Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beatafaron/loan-credit-risk-and-population-stability).
2. **Exploration**:
    - Explored LendingClub's business model and credit risk context.
    - Performed initial data cleaning and identified the schema for ETL.
3. **Multi-source Simulation**:
      - Split the dataset into 6 structured tables for better processing using pyspark.    
      - 3 tables on postgres, 3 on AWS S3. <br>
